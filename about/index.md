# About



Adventurer Allan Dixon is a Irish/Canadian self-taught adventure content marketer. After graduating in Computer Engineering he built a number of startup internet companies but they unfortunately resulted in failure. Learning from all this, he thought there was more to life than programming in front of a computer for the rest of his life. He reignited his passion for filming and photography with the aim of making it a living.

His love for media started in 1999 with recording himself and friends skateboarding on video cassette tapes. Many broken cameras later he was uploading videos on Youtube in 2005. After trial and error he started tweaking videos and emotions to figure out what engages people. Finally he cracked it, a few Youtube successes later companies started hiring him to make video content for them.

Following on from his experience he applied his media knowledge and recently won the 2013 â€™Best Job in the World' campaign by Tourism Australia by competing against over half a million contestants. His job was to showcase why Australia is such a great
country to travel to. This media enriching experience was the final revelation to peruse a full time career in adventure content marketing.

Since then his creative thinking, motivation and drive has lead to some great opportunities working with Web Summit, Tourism Australia, Red Bull Ireland, Bebo, Nokia, Sony Hong Kong, SUPforAll, Dogpatch Labs, Tourism Queensland, Tourism Tasmania.

His work has been featured by Time Magazine, Youtube, Instagram, Mashable, Buzzfeed and The Huffington Post.

Allan's TEDx talk explains some of the highlights above and how making yourself vulnerable through user generated content will lead you to succeed.
