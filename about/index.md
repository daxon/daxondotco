# About



Adventurer Allan Dixon is a Irish/Canadian self-taught adventure content marketer. After graduating in Computer Engineering he built a number of startup internet companies but they unfortunately resulted in failure. Learning from all this, he thought there was more to life than programming in front of a computer for days on end. He reignited his passion for filming and photography with the aim of making it a living.

His love for media started in 1999 with recording himself and friends skateboarding on video cassette tapes. Many broken cameras later he was uploading videos on Youtube in 2005. After trial and error he started tweaking videos and emotions to figure out what engages people. Finally he cracked it, a few Youtube successes later companies started hiring him to make video content for them.

Following on from his experience he applied his media knowledge and won the 2013 ’Best Job in the World' campaign by Tourism Australia in competing against over half a million contestants. His job was to showcase why Australia is such a great
country to travel to. This media enriching experience was the final revelation to peruse a full time career in adventure content marketing.

More recently he is now known as a modern day ‘Dr Dolittle’, Allan’s animal selfies went viral in early 2016 and were featured in countless mainstream media outlets around the world. Instagram themselves featured it, making it amoungst one of their most liked photos of all time.

With creative thinking, motivation and drive, it lead to some great opportunities working with Web Summit, Tourism Australia, Red Bull Ireland, Bebo, Nokia, Sony Hong Kong, SUPforAll, Dogpatch Labs, Tourism Queensland, YHA Australia, Tourism Tasmania.

His work has been featured by Time Magazine, Youtube, Instagram, Mashable, Buzzfeed and The Huffington Post.

Allan's TEDx talk explains how he achieves some of the highlights above and how making yourself vulnerable through user generated content will lead you to succeed.
